					Thank you for running this order and taking care of the customer! Please be sure to make notes of 
					all attempts to contact the end user, successful or not. Should any rescheduling of the service event 
					need to take place, please use the option to reschedule on the web page, or at least leave the date 
					and time in the notes. If there were some sort of complication in being able to run this order on time, 
					those notes would show you have made the effort to contact the end user and attempted to schedule a 
					repair event within the service window. Also, please use the IVR when you are on site.
