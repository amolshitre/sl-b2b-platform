## There's a subtle bug in this build project:
##   - BaconWeb requires project AAA, which in turn requires BBB.
##   - If SLCB/lib/generated/AAA.jar doesn't exist, it gets built.
##   - AAA in turn builds BBB.jar if it doesn't exist.
##   - If AAA exists, but BBB doesn't, BaconWeb itself will find and build BBB (good!)
##   - HOWEVER!!!  BBB.jar will NEVER get included in BaconWeb.war, 
##      because only items in BaconWeb's 'generated' list make it into the BaconWeb 'war'.
##
## Therefore, if you want BBB.jar in your warfile, you MUST add it to BaconWeb.generated.
##
## Also note that since BBB.jar is NOT in BaconWeb's generated list, 
##    it's NOT included in BaconWeb's java build or test CLASSPATH.
