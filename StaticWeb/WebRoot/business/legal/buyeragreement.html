				<strong class="big">3. Service Order Process.</strong>
				As a Buyer, you have the option of posting your Service Order(s) on the Site on a <strong>"Name Your Price"</strong> or a <strong>"Bid"</strong> basis. Provider Firms elect which of their Providers to make available on the Site and which of their Personnel are authorized to accept Service Order(s) and communicate on their behalf. You select the individual Providers to whom your Service Order(s) are offered. </p>

				</div>
				<div class="span-10 last"> &nbsp;
				</div> </div> 
				<div class="clearfix">
				<div class="span-13"> <p class="indent"><strong>A. <strong>"Name Your Price"</strong> Posted Service Orders.</strong>
				By posting a Service Order using the <strong>"Name Your Price"</strong> option on the Site, you agree such Service Order is a binding offer by you (that will remain open as provided on the Site) and that may be accepted by any of the Provider Firms to whom your offer is sent on the Site. Further, you and the Provider Firms agree that, the first Provider Firm, as determined by ServiceLive, in its sole discretion, to accept a Service Order, will be awarded such Service Order. If a Provider Firm is the first to accept your Service Order, as determined by ServiceLive, a contract exists between you and the Provider Firm for such Service Order. If the Provider Firm conditionally accepts your Service Order (through the Site), then the Provider Firm will be deemed to have counter-offered such Service Order, and a contract will be deemed to be made, if you or such Provider Firm accepts the others' last counter-offer for such Service Order. If another Provider Firm accepts your original Service Order prior to you accepting a Provider Firm's counter-offer (a/k/a conditional acceptance), then the Service Order will be awarded to that other Provider Firm and the counter-offer process will be terminated. If you send a counter-offer, your prior counter-offer will be deemed automatically revoked if it has not already been accepted by a Provider Firm (as determined by ServiceLive in its sole discretion). </p>

				</div>
				<div class="span-10 last"> <p class="pullquote">
				When you post a job (a Service Order) using <strong>"Name Your Price"</strong> the first contractor (provider) to accept your job, at the time, and on the terms, you want, gets the work. </p>
					</div> 
				</div> 
				<div class="clearfix">
				<div class="span-13"> <p class="indent"><strong>B. Bid Posted Service Orders. </strong>
				For Service Orders you post using the <strong>"bid"</strong> option on the Site you agree that: (I) when you accept a Provider Firm's bid (a/k/a their offer) by clicking <strong>"Accept Bid"</strong> (or similar) on the Site, a contract will exist between you and such Provider Firm, (II) you and each Provider Firm may comment upon an open Service Order and ServiceLive may share such comments with all of the Provider Firms to whom your Service Order was routed; and (III) Provider Firms may revoke, modify or submit new bids at any time, as provided for on the Site, prior to acceptance by you. If a Provider Firm sends a new bid, their prior bid will be deemed automatically revoked if it has not already been accepted by you (as determined by ServiceLive in its sole discretion). </p> </p>

				</div>
				<div class="span-10 last"> <p class="pullquote">
				Your Service Order, together with the SO Communications, including your provider's responses become your contract.

				You are responsible for what you say on the Site. </p>
					</div> 
				</div> 
				<div class="clearfix">
				<div class="span-13"> <p class="indent"><strong>C. Communications and User Content. </strong>
				You may send information to the Provider Firms to whom you have sent a Service Order (and those Provider Firms may send you information, each such communication a <strong>"SO Communication"</strong>), through tools on the Site (for example, through the Site's communication monitor functionality, via chat, or other means). Information posted by you or by your Personnel on or through the Site, including in your Service Order and counter-offers (for example, job descriptions, pictures, documents, etc.) and in other SO Communications constitutes <strong>"User Content"</strong> and per the Terms ServiceLive is free to use such User Content, without restriction or payment of any kind to you. You must use the Site to communicate changes in the scope your Service Orders, changes in appointment date, and changes in price and terms. You should also communicate such changes directly to the Provider who is performing the work for you. The Provider who accepts your Service Order is your contractor and you should clearly communicate your expectations to him/her the same as you would to any service professional who you hire. </p>

				</div>
				<div class="span-10 last"> <p class="pullquote">
				Our SO Communication feature allows you to exchange information with providers.
				<br><br>
				We can re-use any Content you post.

				You are responsible for all SO Communications by your Personnel (e.g., questions, comments, counter-offers, etc.), and all SO Communications must be made in an appropriate, business like manner in accordance with these Terms (including restrictions on obscenities or other offense materials). All SO Communications must be directly related to the underlying Service Order. It is a violation of these Terms for any Member (or their Personnel) to disparage any other Member, or their products or services in any SO Communication. SO Communications which are sent prior to the acceptance of the Service Order (or bid or counter-offer), as determined by ServiceLive in it sole judgment, will be sent to the Buyer who issued the Service Order and all Provider Firms who received the original Service Order. Once the Service Order (or final bid or counter-offer) has been accepted, SO Communications will only be sent to the issuing Buyer and the Provider Firm awarded such Service Order; provided that ServiceLive reserves the right to monitor all SO Communications (but ServiceLive is under no obligation to so monitor). You are responsible for all communications (e.g., Service Orders, SO Communications, etc.) posted on the Site under your or your Personnel's User Ids, regardless of whether you authorized such communications. </p>

				<div class="span-13"> <p class="indent"><strong>E. Your Contract with the Provider Firm. </strong>
				If your Service Order is accepted by a Provider Firm (or you accept a bid or counter-offer), as determined by ServiceLive in its sole discretion, the contract between you and such Provider Firm consists of your Service Order, any SO Communications sent by the parties (unless otherwise specified by them), including, if applicable, the bid or counter-offer that was accepted.  Once a Service Order (or bid/counteroffer is accepted) the funds that you have loaded into your ServiceLive Wallet for such Service Order will be unavailable for payment of other Service Orders unless and until the original Service Order is canceled (or the spend limit is decreased).</p>

				</div>
				<div class="span-10 last"> &nbsp;
				</div> </div> <div class="clearfix">
				<div class="span-13"> <p class="indent"><strong>F. Other Service Order Terms. </strong>
				You retain the right to withdraw or modify a Service Order at any time, as provided for on the Site, and subject to these Terms. All modifications to a Service Order must be processed through the Site. Except in those instances where ServiceLive has elected, in its sole discretion to accept or bid on a Service Order as a Provider Firm: (I) ServiceLive does not control any part of your Service Order(s) or the contract between you and the Provider Firm; (II) ServiceLive does not set or endorse: (1) the price, contract terms, quality, conformance or legality of the Service Orders advertised; or (2) the ability of the accepting Provider Firm to offer its services and/or perform accordingly, (III) ServiceLive does not control whether the Provider Firm will complete the Service Order they (or their Providers) accept, (IV) ServiceLive may make suggestions about how to alter your Service Order to increase the chances that it will be accepted; if you accept such suggestions you do so at your risk, and (V) Service Live is not responsible for any Service Order and/or contract, or the result of any such Service Order and/or contract made between you and the Provider Firm. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="span-10 last"> <p class="pullquote">
				You can change or cancel your Service Order at any time. Cancellation charges may apply. <br><br>
				ServiceLive is not a part of your contract with your provider. </p>

				</div> </div> <div class="clearfix">
				<div class="span-13"> <p class="indent"><strong>G. Your Obligations to ServiceLive. </strong>
				If you post a Service Order, you agree (for ServiceLive's benefit) that you: (I) will not claim that ServiceLive is a party to any Service Order between you and such Provider Firm (unless ServiceLive elects, in its sole discretion, to accept or bid on such Service Order as a Provider Firm), (II) you are authorizing ServiceLive to divulge the content of such Service Order and your and your Personnel's contact information to the Provider Firms you have selected, and (III) will have a representative who is 18 years or older present at all times while the Services under the Service Order are being performed; and (V) will not circumvent usage of the Site by requesting or permitting any services to be performed or products to be sold that are not specified in a Service Order (as modified from time to time), through the Site. The terms of this Section 3.G will not be deemed to be part of the contract between the Provider Firm and you unless such terms are set forth in the applicable Service Order between the Provider Firm and you. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="span-10 last"> <p class="pullquote">
				These are some basic rules that apply when you post a Service Order. </p>

				<div class="span-13"> <p class="indent"><strong>H. Service Order Completion Verification. </strong>

				Once the Provider has completed a Service Order to your satisfaction in accordance with its terms, the Provider will complete a Service Order Completion Verification form. In order to pay the Provider Firm, you then need to click the <strong>"Approve To Pay"</strong> button (or similar) on the Site (if you fail to do so the Provider Firm will not be paid and they may contact you for payment). You may elect to click the <strong>"Approve To Pay"</strong> button (or similar) on the Site prior to completion of the Service Order - in which case the applicable funds will be held in your ServiceLive Wallet until the Provider Firm states the work has been completed - at which time it will be automatically transferred to the Provider Firm. Once you click the <strong>"Approve To Pay"</strong> button (or similar) on the Site, you can not stop transfer of the applicable funds and you are not entitled to a refund, for any reason, through the Site. Any requests for refunds must be made directly to your Provider Firm. </p> </div> <div class="span-10 last">
				<p class="pullquote"> When your job is done, the person who provided the Service, the Provider, needs to complete a <strong>"Completion Verification Form."</strong> <br><br> After that, if you are satisfied with the work, you click <strong>"Approve to Pay"</strong> on the Site.

				<p class="indent"><strong>I. Service Order Cancellation. </strong> You may cancel a Service Order, at any time, subject to any applicable cancellation fees (as set forth on the Site from time to time) which will be deducted from amounts due you, however ServiceLive may publish cancellation percentages in your public profile and such actions may affect our rating of you on the Site.

				<p class="indent"><strong>J. Posting and Service Order Fees. </strong>
				 Unless such fee is waived on the Site, you agree to pay to ServiceLive a posting fee for each Service Order posted by you or your Personnel (the <strong>"Posting Fee"</strong>). The Posting Fee will be a non-refundable ten dollars ($10.00) per Service Order posting. You will have the right to modify and/or delete the Service Order until a Provider Firm accepts your Service Order (however additional fees may apply). In the event your Service Order is not accepted, you will have the right to repost the same Service Order within 30 days, at no additional Posting Fee. In addition, you agree to pay the applicable Provider Firm the amount agreed for each Service Order completed in accordance with the Service Order.

ServiceLive has no obligation to pay Provider Firms, but may do so on behalf of its affiliates and certain commercial Buyers for whom ServiceLive has separately agreed in writing to provide such Service. You authorize ServiceLive to deduct from funds due you from the Payment System any amounts you owe ServiceLive.

				 No payment will be made to Provider Firm until you click the <strong>"Approve to Pay"</strong> button. You may elect to dispute all or a portion of the agreed upon charges under a Service Order. ServiceLive does not control your decisions and ServiceLive can not compel payment by you. If you fail to pay a Provider Firm for services they provide, they may attempt to enforce any rights they have for payment directly against you. ServiceLive may provide limited assistance in resolving disputes between Buyers and Providers Firms when both parties agree to participate in ServiceLive's voluntary dispute resolution assistance process and when final payment for services has not been issued. By participating in such process: (I) you authorized ServiceLive to disclose to the other party all information that ServiceLive has regards to the dispute (including information provided by you), (II) you waive any claims against ServiceLive or its representatives (including members of the dispute resolution committee) arising in connection with your use of the dispute resolution process (including any claims related to any recommended resolutions of your dispute) and your further agree to indemnify and hold harmless ServiceLive and its representatives from such claims.
