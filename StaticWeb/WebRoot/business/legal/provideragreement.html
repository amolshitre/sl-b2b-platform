							<strong>3. Service Order Process. </strong>As a Provider Firm,
							you elect which of your Providers to make available on the Site
							and which of your Personnel are authorized to accept Service
							Orders and otherwise communicate on your behalf. Buyers have the
							option of posting Service Order(s) on the Site on a "Name Your

						</p>
					</tr>

					<tr>
						<td valign="top"><p class="ind20">
								<strong>A. "Name Your Price" Posted Service Orders</strong> By
								posting a Service Order using the "Name Your Price" option on
								the Site, each Buyer agrees such Service Order(s) are a binding
								offer (that will remain open as provided on the Site) and that
								may be accepted by any of the Provider Firms to whom such offer
								is sent on the Site. Further, you and each Buyer agree that, the
								first Provider Firm, as determined by ServiceLive, in its sole
								discretion, to accept a Service Order, will be awarded such
								Service Order. If you are the first to accept a Service Order,
								as determined by ServiceLive, a contract will exist between you
								and the Buyer for such Service Order. If you conditionally
								accept a Service Order (through the Site), then you will be
								deemed to have counter-offered such Service Order, and a
								contract will be deemed to be made, if you or such Buyer accepts
								the others' last counter-offer for such Service Order. If
								another Provider Firm accepts the Buyer's original Service Order
								prior to the Buyer accepting your counter-offer (a/k/a
								conditional acceptance), then the Service Order will be awarded
								to that other Provider Firm and the counter-offer process will
								be terminated. If you send a counter-offer, your prior
								counter-offer will be deemed automatically revoked if it has not
								already been accepted by the Buyer (as determined by ServiceLive
								in its sole discretion).<br>
								<br> <strong>B.Bid Posted Service Orders.</strong> For
								Service Orders posted using the "bid" option on the Site you
								agree that: (I) any bids posted on the Site by you are a binding
								offer by you that may be accepted by any of the Buyers to whom
								your offer is sent on the Site and that such offer will remain
								open as provided for on the Site, (II) when a Buyer accepts your
								bid (a/k/a your offer) by clicking "Accept Bid" (or similar) on
								the Site, a contract will exist between you and such Buyer, (II)
								you and the Buyer may comment upon an open Service Order and
								ServiceLive may share such comments with the Buyer and the other
								Provider Firms to whom such Service Order was routed; and (III)
								you may revoke, modify or submit new bids at any time, as
								provided for on the Site, prior to acceptance by a Buyer. If you
								send a new bid your prior bid will be deemed automatically
								revoked if it has not already been accepted by the Buyer (as
								determined by ServiceLive in its sole discretion).<br>
								<br> <strong>C. Communications and User Content. </strong>
								You may send information to a Buyer who has sent your Providers
								a Service Order (and such Buyer may send you information, each
								such communication a ("SO Communication"), through tools on the
								Site (for example, through the Site's communication monitor
								functionality, via chat, or other means). Information posted by
								you or by your Personnel on or through the Site, including in
								your bids and counter-offers (for example, job descriptions,
								pictures, documents, etc.) and in other SO Communications
								constitutes "User Content" and per the Terms of Use, ServiceLive
								is free to use such User Content, without restriction or payment
								of any kind to you. You must use the Site to communicate changes
								in scope of the Service Orders you are awarded, changes in
								appointment dates, and changes in price and terms. You should
								also communicate such changes directly to the Buyer. The Buyer
								who issues the Service Order is the person or entity that
								retained you and you should clearly communicate with him/her the
								same as you would with any customer of yours. You may not tell
								the Buyer (or any other person) that you work for ServiceLive,
								you are "from ServiceLive" or otherwise indicate that you have
								any relationship with ServiceLive (other than as a Provider Firm
								listed on the Site).<br>
								<br> You are responsible for all SO Communications by your
								Personnel (e.g., questions, comments, bids, counter-offers,
								etc.), and all SO Communications must be made in an appropriate,
								business-like manner in accordance with this Agreement
								(including restrictions on obscenities or other offensive
								materials). All SO Communications must be directly related to
								the underlying Service Order. It is a violation of this
								Agreement for any Provider Firm (or their Personnel) to
								disparage any other Provider Firm or Buyer, or their products or
								services in any SO Communication. SO Communications which are
								sent prior to the acceptance of the Service Order (or bid or
								counter-offer), as determined by ServiceLive in its sole
								judgment, will be sent to the Buyer who issued the Service Order
								and all Provider Firms who received the original Service Order.
								Once the Service Order (or final bid or counter-offer) has been
								accepted, SO Communications will only be sent to the issuing
								Buyer and the Provider Firm awarded such Service Order; provided
								that ServiceLive reserves the right to monitor all SO
								Communications (but ServiceLive is under no obligation to
								monitor). You are responsible for all communications (e.g.,
								Service Orders, SO Communications, etc.) posted on the Site
								under your or your Personnel's User Ids, regardless of whether
								you authorized such communications.<br>
								<br> <strong>D. Your Contract with the Buyer. </strong> If
								you are awarded a Service Order, the contract between you and
								the issuing Buyer consists of the Service Order, any SO
								Communications sent by the parties (unless otherwise specified
								by them), including, if applicable, the counter-offer or bid
								that was accepted as provided above.<br>
								<br> <strong>E. Other Service Order Terms. </strong> The
								Buyer retains the right to withdraw or modify a Service Order at
								any time, as provided for on the Site, and subject to this
								Agreement. All modifications to a Service Order must be
								processed through the Site. Except in those instances where
								ServiceLive has elected, in its sole discretion to post, accept
								or bid on a Service Order as a Buyer or a Provider Firm: (I)
								ServiceLive does not control any part of the Service Order(s) or
								the contract between you and the Buyer; (II) ServiceLive does
								not set or endorse: (1) the contract terms, quality, conformance
								or legality of the Service Orders advertised; or (2) the ability
								of Buyers to offer Service Orders on an independent contractor,
								employment or any other type of working relationship; and (III)
								ServiceLive does not control whether any Buyer will pay the fees
								they agree to pay, (IV) ServiceLive may make suggestions about
								how to alter your bid or counteroffer to increase the chances
								that it will be accepted; if you accept such suggestions you do
								so at your risk, and (V) Service Live is not responsible for any
								Service Order and/or contract, or the result of any such Service
								Order and/or contract made between you and the Buyer. The
								parties agree that no promises or representations have been made
								as to the potential number of Service Orders that you will
								receive during the term of this Agreement. <br>
								<br> <strong>F. Your Obligations to ServiceLive. </strong>If
								you post a bid, counter-offer or you accept a Service Order, you
								agree (for ServiceLive's benefit) that you: (I) accept the
								Buyer's terms contained in the Service Order (as modified by
								Buyer and you through the Site), (II) will not charge the Buyer
								more than the maximum amount (the "Spend Limit") specified by
								the Buyer as set forth in the Service Order, (III) are (by such
								acceptance, bid or counter-offer) directing ServiceLive to
								divulge your and your Personnel's contact information to the
								Buyer who posted the Service Order, (IV) will evaluate the
								location and site where the Service Order will be performed (the
								"<strong>Service Location</strong>"), verify that the services
								under the Service Order can be performed in accordance with its
								terms (including the payment terms and the timeline for
								completion of the Service Order as set forth in the Service
								Order), and obtain all necessary materials and equipment to
								perform as specified in the Service Order; (V) will perform the
								Services in a neat, professional, good and workmanlike manner
								strictly in accordance with the Service Order and all
								specifications therein; (VI) will also perform the Services in
								accordance with all applicable: established trade practices,
								manufacturer specifications, laws, rules, regulations,
								ordinances or other lawful requirements, as subsequently
								revised, (VII) (VII) will not provide any services at any
								location unless a Buyer's representative (who must be 18 years
								or older) is present at all times; (VIII) will, at your sole
								cost and expense, repair any and all damage caused by you or
								your Personnel; (IX) remove from the Service Location all of
								your materials and/or equipment and all debris and other garbage
								arising from performance of the Service Order (unless otherwise
								agreed in the Service Order); (X) will provide ServiceLive with
								a complete list of all employees, material suppliers and
								laborers to be utilized on any Service Order as requested by
								ServiceLive from time to time during the Term of this Agreement,
								as such Term may be extended, (XI) will not circumvent usage of
								the Site by providing any services or products not specified in
								a Service Order (as modified from time to time), issued through
								the Site, and (XII) will not claim that ServiceLive is a party
								to any Service Order between you and a Buyer (unless ServiceLive
								elects, in its sole discretion, to post a Service Order on its
								own behalf). In the event you fail to timely complete a Service
								Order in accordance with the requirements set forth in the
								Terms, then you will be responsible for all costs and expenses
								incurred by ServiceLive in connection with your failure. The
								terms of this Section 3.F will not be deemed to be part of the
								contract between you and the Buyer unless such terms are set
								forth in the applicable Service Order between you and the Buyer.<br>
								<br> <strong>G. Service Order Completion
									Verification. </strong> Once you have completed a Service Order in
								accordance with its terms, you must complete a Service Order
								completion verification form via the Site (as posted on the Site
								from time to time), notifying the Buyer and ServiceLive that
								your firm has completed the Service Order (Buyers generally will
								not pay you until you complete this step). Once you have
								completed such form, the Buyer needs to click the "Approve To
								Pay" button on the Site to transfer the Service Order Fee to you
								(net of the ServiceLive Transaction Fee described below). <br>
								<br> <strong>H. Service Order Cancellation. </strong> A
								Buyer may cancel a Service Order, at any time, subject to any
								applicable cancellation fees (as set forth on the Site from time
								to time). You may release (cancel) a Service Order without
								monetary penalty, however ServiceLive may publish release
								percentages in your public profile and such actions may affect
								your ratings.<br>
								<br> <strong>I. Transaction Fees. </strong> You agrees to
								pay to ServiceLive a transaction fee for each Service Order
								completed (the "Transaction Fee"). The "Transaction Fee" will
								equal ten percent (10%) of the fees owed to you by the Buyer for
								completed Service Orders. You authorize the deduction of such
								Transaction Fee from amounts to be paid to you. ServiceLive
								reserves the right to change the amount of the Transaction Fee
								from time to time and the amount of the Transaction Fee
								applicable to any Service Order will be reflected in the fees
								computed and displayed on the Site.<br>
								<br> <strong>J. Venue. </strong> You agree that ServiceLive
								is simply acting as a marketplace venue for Buyers and Provider
								Firms. Except for Service Orders posted under ServiceLive' name,
								ServiceLive is under no obligation to pay for services you
								perform in connection with any Service Order. If ServiceLive
								voluntarily undertakes to pay you, you agree to pay to
								ServiceLive any compensation you receive from the Buyer and you
								agree to waive all of your rights and claims against such Buyer.
								ServiceLive is not responsible for any wage withholdings
								regarding your Personnel nor is ServiceLive responsible for the
								determination of whether any sales and use taxes apply to any
								Service Order transactions.<br>
								<br> <strong>K. ServiceLive Verified. </strong> From time
								to time, ServiceLive may, but is not obligated to, review
								documents provided by a Provider Firm (e.g. insurance
								certificates, training certifications, etc.), and if
								ServiceLive, in its sole judgment, is satisfied that such
								document appears authentic, mark such document as "ServiceLive
								Verified." You acknowledge that ServiceLive does not guaranty
								the authenticity or accuracy of such document or that such
								document is in force, or that it was properly obtained by the
								Provider Firm posting it. You agree that you will not rely upon
								a document's "ServiceLive Verified" status and that ServiceLive
								will have no liability to you in connection with such documents
								(including ServiceLive's marking a document as "ServiceLive
								Verified"). You must determine for yourself what, if any,
								reliance you choose to place on such documents.
							</p>
					</tr>

					<p class="ind20">
						<strong>A. Payments. </strong> Unless otherwise approved by
						ServiceLive in advance and in writing, all payments related to
						Service Orders must be made through the ServiceLive authorized
						payment system ("<strong>Payment System</strong>"). Use of the
						Payment System is subject to the following separate <a
							href="/MarketFrontend/termsAndConditions_displayBucksAgreement.action">terms
							and conditions</a>. In the event that a Buyer fails to pay you for
						work contracted for through the ServiceLive platform, ServiceLive
						has no obligation to pay you, but may do so on behalf of its
						affiliates and certain commercial Buyers for whom ServiceLive has
						separately agreed in writing to provide such Service. You
						authorize ServiceLive to deduct any amounts you owe ServiceLive.<br>
						<br> <strong>B. Disputes. </strong> No payment will be made
						to you if the Buyer does not click the "Approve to Pay" button.
						The Buyer may elect to dispute all or a portion of the agreed upon
						charges under a Service Order. ServiceLive does not control such
						decisions by Buyer and ServiceLive cannot compel payment by the
						Buyer. ServiceLive may provide limited assistance in resolving
						disputes between Buyers and Providers Firms when both parties
						agree to participate in ServiceLive's voluntary dispute resolution
						assistance process and when final payment for services has not
						been issued. By participating in such process: (I) you authorize
						ServiceLive to disclose to the other party all information that
						ServiceLive has regarding the dispute (including information
						provided by you), (II) you waive any claims against ServiceLive or
						its representatives (including members of the dispute resolution
						committee) arising in connection with your use of the dispute
						resolution process (including any claims related to any
						recommended resolutions of your dispute) and you further agree to
						indemnify and hold harmless ServiceLive and its representatives
						from such claims. If you are unable to resolve a dispute with a
						Buyer regarding services you have performed, you may attempt to
						enforce any rights you have for payment directly against the Buyer
						(subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement).

							<strong>5. Rating System. </strong> The Site includes a
							proprietary rating system for Buyers and Providers and Provider
							Firms which allows you to rate, on a variety of factors, each
							Buyer. All ratings submitted will be deemed User Content. In
							addition, ServiceLive may: (A) collect information on the Buyer
							and Buyer's use of the Site, (B) collect information about you
							(and your Personnel's) use of the Site (including number of
							Service Orders accepted, number of Service Orders
							cancelled/rejected, etc.), and then (C) combine such information
							into a rating for the Buyer, you and/or separate ratings for the
							each Provider who has a profile on the Site, and (D) display such
							information to other users of the Site. ServiceLive reserves the
							right to reject certain ratings, but ServiceLive is not
							responsible for the User Content of Provider Firm ratings. Each
							Provider Firm is responsible for ratings posted on its behalf and
							must comply with the Terms when making such ratings.

					<tr>
						<p>
							<strong>6. Criminal Background Checks. As a means of
								ensuring the safety of Buyers, before Providers and their
								Personnel enter a Buyer's home, Provider agrees to screen its
								Personnel by conducting a lawful background check upon Personnel
								who will be entering a Buyer's home. The check must include, at
								a minimum: (a) a nationwide criminal history database search
								with county level follow-up searches for any records found; (b)
								a county level criminal history search for each count of
								Personnel's residence for the last seven (7) years; and (c) a
								statewide sex offender registry search as allowed by law. The
								background check must be performed by a screener accredited by
								the National Association of Professional Background Screeners.
								Provider agrees to evaluate every background check on an
								individual basis in accordance with the law. To the fullest
								extent permitted by law, and in accordance with any regulations
								or administrative guidance, Provider shall not authorize or
								permit any Personnel to enter a Buyer's premises who has, within
								the past seven (7) years been convicted of (or released from
								incarceration for) a felony involving violence, theft, fraud, or
								who is currently on a sex offender registry. Provider accepts
								responsibility and liability for compliance with all laws
								related to the conduct of background checks. Further,
								ServiceLive reserves the right to run a background check in
								compliance with this provision on any Provider before Provider
								enters a Buyer's premises. </strong> You acknowledge that ServiceLive
							will have no liability for such background checks, regardless of
							whether ServiceLive selects the background check provider and/or
							pays for the background checks. Further, you acknowledge that
							every background check process has limitations and that you agree
							that ServiceLive will have no liability for excluding you from
							the Site based upon the results of a background check (even if
							such results are incorrect).

					<tr>
						<p>
							<strong>7. Default. </strong> In the event that you (or any of
							your Personnel) breach this Agreement, ServiceLive has the right
							to immediately suspend and/or terminate your Membership for
							cause. Such breaches include:</br>
						<p class="ind20">
							A. Any breach of your obligations hereunder; <br>B. Any
							failure by you to commence or diligently pursue the completion of
							a Service Order accepted by you in accordance this Agreement; <br>C.

							interfere with or have adverse effect on ServiceLive, the Site or
							its Members; <br>H. If you are convicted by a court of, or
							plead no contest to, a felony, or other crime or offense
							involving theft, fraud, violence, or sexual offense during the
							Term (subject to an individualized assessment and in accordance
							with law); <br>I. If you violate Section 16 (Confidential
							Information). <br>J. If you fail to maintain in force any
							required insurance coverages or licenses; or <br>K. If you

							<strong>8. Relationship and Obligations of Parties. </strong>
						</p>
					</tr>

					<tr>
						<p class="ind20">
							<strong>A.</strong> ServiceLive is not an employer or joint
							employer of Provider or any Provider Personnel, and neither this
							Agreement nor any activity undertaken in connection with this
							Agreement will create an employer-employee relationship, a joint
							employment relationship or a guarantee of a future offer of
							employment. Provider shall not, and shall ensure that all
							Provider Personnel do not, make any statements or engage in any
							conduct that would lead someone to believe that ServiceLive is an
							employer or joint employer of Provider or any Provider
							Personnel.. ServiceLive is not involved in your hiring, firing,
							discipline or employment or other decisions. If an arbitrator,
							mediator or a court determines, notwithstanding this provision,
							that a Provider (or its Personnel) are agents of ServiceLive, so
							your release, waivers and indemnities and other obligations under
							Sections 10 and 12 below will apply to the Buyer. <br>
							<br> <strong>B. </strong>ServiceLive and its affiliates may
							participate in the venue as Buyers and Provider Firms for Service
							Orders they elect, in their sole discretion, to post or accept or
							bid upon. You agree that, except in those instances where
							ServiceLive has posted a Service Order in its own name,

							terms and conditions of your contracting arrangement with any
							Buyer and that any services you provide pursuant to a Service
							Order are provided by and under separate agreement between you

							not provide Buyer or you with any materials or tools with which
							to perform any Service Order. Any problems, complaints or
							questions regarding the work environment, performance or other
							terms and conditions of contracting must be resolved by and
							between you and the Buyer who hires you.<br>
							<br> <strong>C. </strong>You shall ensure that in performing
							your obligations with respect to this Agreement, you and your
							Personnel shall comply with all laws, including, but not limited,
							to any and all applicable licensing, permitting, construction,
							home improvement, environmental, consumer privacy, data security,

							and state anti- discrimination laws, state labor codes and
							employment laws, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the

							harmless and indemnify ServiceLive for any and all liability
							arising from a violation of any such laws, statutes, ordinances
							and/or regulations. Provider shall be fully responsible and
							liable to ServiceLive for the acts and omissions of its Provider
							Personnel.<br>
							<br> <strong>D. </strong> Provider shall not perform any
							Services in which it uses or incorporates, in whole or in part,
							any asbestos, asbestos-containing materials or other hazardous
							materials as defined from time to time by applicable federal or
							state laws, rules and regulations in any aspect of its Services.
							Additionally, Provider acknowledges and agrees as follows: (a)
							Provider understands that the Service Location at which it is
							performing the Services may not have been tested for asbestos or
							labeled with asbestos warning signs; (b) if the Services that
							Provider is going to perform involves construction, repair or
							maintenance relating to ceiling tile, floor tile,
							sprayed-on-fireproofing, or boiler, pipe and duct insulation,
							Provider must presume that asbestos is present in these materials
							unless tests indicate otherwise; and if Provider does not have
							documentation that any such material is asbestos free, the
							material must be tested for asbestos under the direction of
							Buyerâ€™s Environment Department before disturbance by Provider;
							and (c) if Provider discovers an existing or suspected presence
							of any asbestos, asbestos-containing materials or other hazardous
							materials in any area of a Service Location while performing its
							Services, Provider shall immediately cease Services in that area,
							notify both the Buyer in writing of the discovery, continue
