					related products and services (collectively the &quot;<u>Payment
						Service</u>&quot;) used in connection with products and services you
					buy or provide through the on-line marketplace (&quot;<u>ServiceLive
						Site</u>&quot;) provided by Transform ServiceLive LLC. (&quot;<u>ServiceLive</u>&quot;).
					Hereafter in this Agreement, references to we, us, our or IPS shall
					also mean our agents, including ServiceLive, and IPS or
					ServiceLive's affiliates. You must be a member of the ServiceLive
					Site (hereafter, a &quot;<u>Member</u>&quot;) in order to use the
					Payment Service. As used in this Agreement, the terms &quot;<u>you</u>&quot;

					Service may only be used in connection with products provided
					within and services performed within the United States. The Payment
					Service may not be used by you to make payments outside the United
					States
				</p>
				<p>
					This Agreement applies to your use of the Payment Service whether
					you are a Buyer User or a Provider User. This Agreement does not
					apply to your use of the ServiceLive Site generally or services
					provided or obtained thereunder, which are governed by your
					agreement with ServiceLive and/or any other Members with whom you
					choose to transact business. This Agreement explains our and your
					respective legal rights and obligations concerning all aspects of
					our relationship, including without limitation our maintenance of
					ServiceLive Bucks balances (&quot;<u>ServiceLive Bucks Balance</u>&quot;
					or &quot;<u>Balance</u>&quot;), your registered bank account and

					appropriately branded with a Visa, MasterCard, Discover or American
					Express logo (&quot;<u>Bank Card</u>") information and Balance
					(&quot;<u>ServiceLive Wallet</u>&quot;), transaction limits and
					other restrictions, your consent to receive electronic notices, and

					amendment to you through the ServiceLive Site, the Buck Site,
					through any email address you provide or to your last address as
					shown in our records. Unless necessary to protect system security,
					you will be given advance notice prior to any amendment taking
					effect which results in an increased fee or charge, an increase in
					your liability, or a reduction in our services. By maintaining a
					ServiceLive Bucks Balance and/or continued use of the Payment
					Service, you agree to any such changes or amendments. If you do not
					accept an amendment to this Agreement or feature of the Payment
					Service, your sole remedy is to contact us and terminate your
					ServiceLive Bucks Wallet. You are at all times responsible for
					reading and understanding each version of this Agreement</p>

							your username or PIN to any third party (other than third parties
							authorized by you to use your ServiceLive Wallet). If your
							username or PIN is compromised, you must change your username
							and/or PIN immediately and notify us, through our agent,
							ServiceLive, immediately to avoid unauthorized use of your
							ServiceLive Bucks Balance.

							2.1 &nbsp;<b>Our Responsibility.</b> You may make payments to or
							accept payments from other Users using our Service. Except for
							our limited responsibility in processing payments that you
							authorize, initiate or accept, we are not involved in any
							underlying transaction between you and any ServiceLive Member. <b>We
								have no control over the quality, fitness, safety, reliability,
								legality, or any other aspect of (a) any products or services
								that you may pay for or receive payment for using the Payment
								Service. Except for our express obligations under this
								Agreement, you are solely responsible for the transactions that
								you authorize in connection with the Payment Service.</b>
						</p>

						<p>
							2.2 &nbsp;<b>Your Authorization.</b> By agreeing to your
							registration for the Payment Service, you authorize ServiceLive,
							as our agent, to share with us any information ServiceLive may
							have as a result of your use of the ServiceLive Site (e.g., name,
							address, etc.), and you authorize us to hold, receive, and
							disburse funds on your behalf in accordance with your payment
							instructions (subject to the terms of this Agreement and our
							Policies), provided to us through our agent. ServiceLive, or
							otherwise. You acknowledge that (a) we are acting on your behalf
							solely to collect, administer and maintain funds as part of your
							ServiceLive Bucks Balance, (b) we may use the services of one or
							more third party, processors and/or financial institutions to
							provide the Payment Service and process your transactions (each a
							<u>Processor</u>), and (c) no partnership, joint venture,
							employee-employer, franchisee-franchiser, creditor-debtor,
							escrow, or other fiduciary relationship is intended or created by
							the establishment of the ServiceLive Wallet or this Agreement.
							Any time you send ServiceLive Bucks or receive ServiceLive Bucks
							you are doing so at your own risk. We are not your selling agent
							in connection with any sale by you of any products services to
							any person, and we have no liability for, or relationship to, the
							sale or purchase of any products services. We do not issue
							refunds if a product or service turns out to not meet your
							expectations, or if, in the case of a Buyer User, the Provider
							User does not fulfill its commitments; or in the case of a
							Provider User, the Buyer User does not fulfill its commitments;
							in these situations, you should seek recourse, if any, from the
							other participant in your underlying transaction (i.e., the Buyer
							User or Provider User).
						</p>
						<p>
							2.3 &nbsp;<b>Your ServiceLive Bucks</b> <b>Balance.</b> You may
							hold ServiceLive Bucks that you load or receive from other Users
							in your ServiceLive Bucks Balance. When you carry a balance, your
							funds will be co-mingled and held with other Users' funds in one
							or more pooled accounts maintained by us at one or more federally
							insured depository institutions on your behalf and for the
							benefit of you and other users holding balances (each a <u>Pooled
								Account</u>). We have sole discretion over the establishment and
							maintenance of any Pooled Account. We will hold the funds
							associated with your ServiceLive Bucks Balance separate from our
							corporate funds, will not use your funds for our corporate
							purposes (including without limitation the granting of any
							security or similar interest), will not voluntarily make funds
							available to our creditors in the event of bankruptcy or for any
							other purpose, and will not knowingly permit our creditors to
							attach the funds. You will not receive interest or any other
							earnings on any funds that we handle for you. <b>As
								consideration for using the Payment Service, you irrevocably
								assign to us all rights and legal interests to any interest
								and/or other earnings that may accrue or are attributable to our
								holding of your ServiceLive Bucks Balance in a Pooled Account.</b>
						</p>

						<p>
							2.4 &nbsp;<b>Escheatment of Dormant Funds.</b> If there is no
							activity in your ServiceLive Bucks Balance (including without
							limitation access or payment transactions) for at least two (2)
							years or more, and you have a positive Balance, we will notify
							you and give you the option of keeping your ServiceLive Bucks
							Balance open and maintaining the funds or withdrawing the funds.
							If you do not respond to our notice within thirty (30) days, we
							will automatically close your ServiceLive Bucks Balance and
							refund the dollar equivalent of your Service Bucks Balance to
							you. If we can not do so, we may be required to escheat your
							Balance to your state of residency. IPS will determine your
							residency, as it deems appropriate based upon the information it
							has. If you would like to claim your funds from the state, please
							contact your state&trade;s Unclaimed Property Administrator.
						</p>
						<p>
							2.5 &nbsp; <b>Acceptable Use of the Payment Service.</b> You will
							at all times adhere to all applicable laws, rules, and
							regulations applicable to your use of the Payment Service.
							Without limiting the foregoing, you may not act as a payment
							intermediary, aggregator or service bureau or otherwise resell
							the Payment Service on behalf of any third party, including
							without limitation the handling, processing, and transmission of
							funds for any third party. We may inspect your ServiceLive Wallet
							for any reason, including without limitation to investigate any
							alleged violation of this Agreement or any third-party
							complaints. In the event that we determine in our sole and
							reasonable discretion that your conduct or actions (including
							without limitation your employees, if applicable) are
							objectionable, unlawful, potentially infringing on third party
							rights, or otherwise in violation of this Agreement, we may take
							any action that we deem appropriate and reasonable under the
							circumstance to protect our systems, facilities, users, and/or
							third parties. Such corrective action includes, but is not
							limited to: (a) issuing a warning; (b) immediately suspending or
							terminating the Payment Service; and (c) restricting or
							prohibiting access to your ServiceLive Wallet. Subject to
							applicable law, we may access, use, and disclose transaction
							information about your use of our Service or your ServiceLive
							Wallet (including without limitation any transfers to your
							ServiceLive Bucks Balance) to: (1) comply with the law (e.g., a
							lawful subpoena); (2) to enforce or apply our agreements with
							you; (3) initiate, render, bill, and collect for our Service; (4)
							protect our rights or property; or (5) protect users of our
							Service from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of our Service.

                                                       served with a notice of a lien, attachment or garnishment, whether received

                                                       directed by the legal process. This authorization will apply to the funds of a 
                                                       Buyer, User and/or a Provider User. We will have no liability for taking such 
                                                       action, which may result in other items going unpaid.

					<li><b>Your Transactions</b>

						<p>
							3.1 &nbsp;<b>Authorization.</b> You authorize us to debit your
							ServiceLive Bucks Balance to process payment transactions that
							you authorize and collect any fees or amounts that may be owed
							under this Agreement. In the event there is an error in the
							processing of any transaction, you authorize us to initiate debit
							or credit entries to your ServiceLive Bucks Balance or Bank
							Account, as applicable, to correct such error, provided that any
							such correction is made in accordance with applicable laws and
							regulations. If we are unable to debit the Bank Account you
							select for any reason, you authorize us to resubmit the debit,
							plus any applicable fees, to any other Bank Account or payment
							instrument that you have on file with us (or, in the case of any
							fees that are owed under this Agreement, to deduct such amounts
							from your ServiceLive Bucks Balance or Bank Account or charge any
							payment instrument in you ServiceLive Wallet). Your
							authorizations will remain in full force and effect while you
							maintain your ServiceLive Bucks Balance with us and for any Bank
							Account listed in your ServiceLive Wallet.
						</p>
						<p>
							3.2 &nbsp;<b>Funding Sources.</b>
						<blockquote>
							3.2.1 &nbsp;<b>ACH Debit Transactions.</b> You may fund your
							ServiceLive Bucks Balance electronically by transferring money
							from your valid checking, savings or other ACH-enabled bank
							account at a financial institution in the United States (your <u>Bank
								Account</u>). Funds transfers from your Bank Account usually take
							three to four business days to complete. You may be charged a
							return fee for any ACH debit transfer request that is rejected by
							the holding financial institution for any reason (a <u>Return
								Fee</u>), including without limitation rejections caused by
							insufficient funds in your Bank Account, closure of your Bank
							Account, or if the Bank Account number or other information you
							provided is incorrect. Applicable Return Fees may vary based on
							the jurisdiction in which you are located. Your location is
							determined by the address that is associated with your
							ServiceLive Wallet. We do not accept cash, checks, money orders,
							or wire transfers.
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							3.2.1 &nbsp;<b>Bank Card Transactions.</b> You may use Bank Cards
							registered in your ServiceLive Wallet to fund your ServiceLive
							Bucks Balance. In such a case, our agent, ServiceLive, will be
							the merchant that appears on your Bank Card statement. You may
							not use gift cards or other prepaid cards to fund your
							ServiceLive Bucks Balance.
						</blockquote>
						</p>

						<p>
							3.3 &nbsp;<b>Payment Privileges</b>
						<blockquote>
							3.3.1 &nbsp;<b>Transaction Limits.</b> Our agent, ServiceLive,
							may establish limits on a User's ability to, on a self-service
							basis, transfer their Balance to their Bank Card or bank account,
							from time to time. You will be notified through the Buck Site of
							any such limitations. You may manually direct that your entire
							Balance (without regard to the foregoing limits) be transferred
							to your applicable bank account or Bank Card at any time. We may
							require additional information from you to verify your identify
							in connection with such a manual transaction. In addition to any
							stated transaction limit, we may delay, suspend or reject a
							transaction if we suspect the transaction is unauthorized,
							fraudulent, suspicious or otherwise unusual based on prior
							transaction activity and application of our internal fraud
							controls.
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							3.3.2 &nbsp;<b>Sending and Receiving Funds.</b> You may initiate
							payment to any Provider that has provided a product or performed
							a service for you (which may include ServiceLive). The payment
							will not be released to a Provider until you have authorized the
							payment. We are not liable to any person for any damages
							associated with any unaccepted payment.
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							3.3.3 &nbsp;<b>Refunds.</b> You may request a refund of your
							ServiceLive Bucks Balance, or a portion thereof; but only to the
							extent that you, or someone using your PIN, has not authorized
							the transfer of such ServceLive Bucks to another User. If you
							used your Bank Account to fund your ServiceLive Bucks Balance,
							the refund will be made to your Bank Account via an ACH credit to
							your Bank Account. If you used a Bank Card to fund your
							ServiceLive Bucks Balance, the refund will be made to that Bank
							Card. If we can not refund such monies to the applicable Bank
							Account or Bank Card, you will need to contact us, through our
							agent, ServiceLive, to make other arrangements.
						</blockquote>

						</p>
						<p>
							3.4 &nbsp;<b>Availability of Funds.</b> Funds for any given
							transaction will not be available until the transaction is deemed
							complete. As applicable, transactions will be deemed complete
							when we have received or sent the funds. Each time a Buyer posts
							a service order through the ServiceLive Site, the spend limit set
							forth in such service order, shall be held and shall not be
							available for use in any future transaction until such service
							order is completed or cancelled; provided that a Buyer User may
							request a refund of all of its ServiceLive Bucks at any time; in
							which case all open service orders on the ServiceLive Site will
							be cancelled. In addition to restrictions that may already apply
							to your ServiceLive Bucks Balance, we may restrict transactions
							to or from your ServiceLive Bucks Balance or limit access to
							funds in your ServiceLive Bucks Balance in such amounts and for
							such time as we reasonably deem necessary to protect us or other
							users if: (a) we are subject to financial risk, (b) you have
							violated any term of this Agreement, (c) any dispute exists
							involving your ServiceLive Bucks Balance or transaction to which
							you are a party, (d) needed to protect the security of our
							systems; or (e) ServiceLive directs us to limit your access. We
							may restrict access to funds in your ServiceLive Bucks Balance
							for the greater of (1) the time that it takes for us to complete
							any pending investigation or resolve a pending dispute or (2) 180
							days. We also may hold your funds as required by law or court
							order or if otherwise requested by law enforcement or any
							governmental entity.
						</p>
						<p>
							3.5 &nbsp;<b>Receipts; Electronic Account History.</b> When you
							purchase ServiceLive Bucks, you will be provided a receipt which
							you should retain for your records. You may access your
							electronic transaction history and ServiceLive Bucks Balance by
							logging into the Bucks Site through the ServiceLive Site at any
							time.
						</p>
						<p>
							3.6 &nbsp;<b>Disputes.</b>
						<blockquote>
							3.6.1 &nbsp;<b>Buyer Disputes.</b> A Buyer may elect not to
							complete a Service Order Completion Form to dispute all or a
							portion of the agreed upon charges under a Service Order. IPS
							cannot compel a Buyer User to make a payment to a Provider User.
							Provider Users agree to look solely to the other Member with whom
							they have transacted business and not to IPS.
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							3.6.2 &nbsp;<b>Errors and Unauthorized Transactions.</b> You can
							inspect your transaction history at any time by logging into the
							Bucks Site through the ServiceLive Site. It is very important
							that you immediately notify IPS, through our agent, ServiceLive,
							if you have reason to believe any of the following activities
							have occurred: (i) there has been an unauthorized transaction
							from your ServiceLive Bucks Balance; (ii) there has been an
							unauthorized access to your ServiceLive Wallet; (iii) your
							password has been compromised; (iv) someone has transferred or
							may transfer funds from your ServiceLive Bucks Balance without
							your permission (collectively called <u>Improper Account
								Access</u>).
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							3.6.3 &nbsp;<b>Review of Reports of Errors and/or
								Unauthorized Transactions.</b> We will advise you of the results of
							our investigation within 10 Business Days after we receive your
							notice. If we have made an error, we will correct it promptly. If
							we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 Days to
							investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this,
							and your inquiry or complaint involves any amounts in question
							relating to your ServiceLive Bucks Wallet, we may, but we are not
							required to, provisionally credit your ServiceLive Bucks Balance
							for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the
							use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our
							investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in
							writing and we do not receive it within ten (10) Business Days,

							certain other rights in any dispute related to your ServiceLive
							Wallet or this Agreement. (b) Opt Out. If you wish to opt out of

							Association (AAA), as selected by the party electing to use

							(d) In this Arbitration Provision, the term Claim means any
							claim, dispute or controversy between you and us arising from or
							relating to your Card, your Account or this Agreement including
							the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration
							Provision or the Agreement. Claim includes claims of every kind
							and nature, including but not limited to: initial claims,
							counterclaims, cross-claims and third-party claims; claims
							brought under contract, tort, statutory, regulatory or any other
							legal theory; and claims seeking any type of relief (including

							TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR IN THE PROCEDURES
							OF THE NAF OR AAA, AS APPLICABLE (THE PROCEDURES), EXCEPT AS

							CAPACITY OR AS A MEMBER OF ANY CLASS OF CLAIMANTS PERTAINING TO
							ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH BELOW, THE
							ARBITRATOR'S DECISION WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING. NOTE THAT OTHER
							RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE
							AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. (f) Notwithstanding anything to the
							contrary in this Arbitration Provision, either party may file and
							pursue a Claim in a small claims court of your state or
							municipality (Small Claim), but the Claim must proceed only on an
							individual basis and not in a representative capacity or class
							action so long as that Claim is not transferred or appealed to a
							different court, in which case either party may elect
							arbitration. (g) No Claim submitted to arbitration is heard by a
							jury, may be brought as a class action in a court or arbitration
							proceeding, or as a private attorney general. You do not have the
							right to act as a class representative or participate as a member
							of a class of claimants with respect to any Claim submitted to
							arbitration (Class Action Waiver). The parties to this Agreement
							acknowledge that the Class Action Waiver is material and
							essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties
							and is nonseverable from this agreement to arbitrate Claims. If
							the Class Action Waiver is limited, voided or found
							unenforceable, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate (except
							for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect to such
							proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or
							invalidation of the Class Action Waiver. Any Claim resolved by
							arbitration shall be arbitrated on an individual basis by a
							single arbitrator. The arbitrator&trade;s authority to resolve
							Claims is limited to Claims between you and us alone, and the
							arbitrator's authority to make awards is limited to you and us
							alone. Furthermore, Claims brought by you against us or by us
							against you may not be joined or consolidated in arbitration with
							Claims brought by or against someone other than you. (h) Any
							arbitration hearing that you attend shall take place in the
							federal judicial district of your residence at the time the claim
							is filed. At your written request, we will consider advancing
							and/or reimbursing any arbitration filing fee, or administrative
							and hearing fees that you are required to pay to pursue a Claim
							in arbitration. The arbitrator will decide who will ultimately be
							responsible for paying those fees. If you file a claim against
							us, no event will you be required to reimburse us for any
							arbitration filing, administrative, or hearing fees in an amount
							greater than what your court costs would have been if the Claim
							had been resolved in a state court with jurisdiction. Each party
							shall bear its own attorney&trade;s, expert&trade;s and witness
							fees, which shall not be considered costs of arbitration;
							however, if a statute gives you the right to recover these fees,
							or fees paid to the Administrator, then these statutory rights
							will apply in arbitration. (i) This Arbitration Provision is made
							pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and
							shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.
							Sections 1-16 (the FAA). The arbitration shall be governed by the
							applicable Procedures, except that this Arbitration Provision
							shall control if it is inconsistent with the applicable
							Procedures. The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law
							consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations
							and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law and, at the
							timely written request of either party, shall provide a written
							explanation of the basis for the decision. Judgment upon the
							award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
							having jurisdiction. The arbitrator's decision will be final and
							binding, except as provided by the FAA. (j) Continuation: This
							Arbitration Provision shall survive termination of your Card,
							your Account and this Agreement. If any portion of this
							Arbitration Provision is deemed invalid or unenforceable it shall
							not invalidate the remaining portions of this Arbitration
							Provision or the Agreement, except as provided for in paragraph
							(g) above.
