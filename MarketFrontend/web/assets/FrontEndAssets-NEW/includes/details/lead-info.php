                <p>We are looking to get 2 quotes for some warranty work that needs to be done as soon as possible.  The details are as follows - Approximately 1100 square feet of concrete flooring that needs to be ground back to the original slab.  Valspar sold us a color that did not match the color swatch in their brochure.  Along with the concrete slab being ground back down, the baseboards need to be removed then re-installed or replaced as necessary along with painting.  This is a new construction home and everything needs to be left in new condition as it was before this project.  Most of the floor had a very thin overlay placed before staining and was sealed with outdoor sealant which was sold to us by Lowe's.  Complete cleaning must be included in the quote.  There will be some furniture and appliances that will need to be moved.  The quote must be very detailed in what will be done.<p>
