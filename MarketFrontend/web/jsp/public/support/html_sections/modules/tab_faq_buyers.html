<h3>Frequently Asked Questions - Service Buyers</h3>
<p class="paddingBtm"The following questions are the most commonly asked by homeowners, contractors and people who buy service for organizations through ServiceLive.">
</p>


  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="How do I find a service provider?" id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p> Create and submit a service order and ServiceLive will automatically generate a list of providers with the skills you are looking for. Choose the providers you would like to work with based on their skills and ratings from other providers. The providers you select will be sent notification of your service order. The first to accept your terms wins your business. If a provider accepts with conditions, it's up to the buyer to decide if the conditions are acceptable.</p>
  </div>
  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="How do I pay for work performed?" id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p> Buyers pre-fund their ServiceLive Wallet with an EFT or credit card prior to routing a service order. The money in the account belongs to the buyer until work is completed to the buyer's satisfaction. Until a provider accepts a service order, the buyer may withdraw funds from the ServiceLive Wallet.</p>
  </div>
  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="Why must I pre-fund my ServiceLive Wallet?" id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p> Pre-funding your ServiceLive Wallet demonstrates your commitment to having your service order completed, and offers assurance to service providers making time for your service order on their schedule. It also offers protection to you. You don't have to pay anything to the service provider to start a project and your funds are released to the provider only after you have indicated you are happy with their work.</p>
  </div>
  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="How do I get refunds for service orders that aren't completed?" id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p> Request a refund by e-mailing us at ADDRESS. If payment was made with a credit card, we can only refund to the card number that was given. </p>
  </div>
  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="What if nobody accepts my service order?" id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p> If you route an order that isn't accepted, make sure your scope of work can be clearly understood and that the pay scale is fair. If you would like to re-post, you will not be charged a re-posting fee. In the event that there aren't enough providers in your area to complete the work, contact us at help@servicelive.com and we will attempt to recruit providers in your area that meet your expectations. </p>
  </div>
  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="What is a conditional acceptance?" id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p> Service providers can accept orders they've been selected to receive on conditions. They may want more information about the job, request the job be performed on a different date or they may want more money. </p>
    <p> It's up to the buyer to accept the service pro's new terms. A conditional acceptance does not keep the order from being routed to other providers, so it's possible other providers may accept the work exactly as requested by the buyer. </p>
