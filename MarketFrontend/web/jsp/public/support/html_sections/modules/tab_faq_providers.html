 <!--  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="How many accounts can I establish as a service pro?" id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p>ServiceLive allows two unique service pro accounts per individual and one account per company. Go to <a href="http://www.servicelive.com/provider">www.servicelive.com/provider</a> and set up separate accounts if you wish to have more than one. </p>

  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="Why do I need a background check?" id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p>Since service calls take place in the homes of service customers, we require background checks for all service providers. For a limited time there is no charge for this valuable service, which is performed by our partner, Plus1 Solutions.</p>
  </div>
  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="What categories do buyers rate me on? " id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p>Great service ratings help you earn more business. At the completion of each order, buyers can rate the service provider on the following categories of service:</p> 
      <ul class="vertBulleted">
      <li>Professionalism</li>
      <li>Timeliness</li>
      <li>Cleanliness</li>
      <li>Communication </li>
      <li>Quality of Service</li>
      <li>Value</li></ul>
  </div>
  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="How is my buyer rating figured?" id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p>Each category of your buyer ratings is graded on a 5-point scale. Your overall provider rating is a mean average of all of these categories added together.</p>
  </div>
  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="What other factors figure in to my provider reputation? " id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p>In addition to buyer ratings, your ServiceLive reputation will be based on behavioral metrics tracked by the site. These metrics, which will be posted along with customer ratings, include, without limitation: </p>
      <ul class="vertBulleted">
      <li>Frequency of orders accepted, then rejected</li>
      <li>Frequency of orders accepted with conditions</li>
      <li>Frequency of orders declined.</li></ul>
  </div>
  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="What is a conditional acceptance?" id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p>Service providers can accept orders they&#8217;ve been selected to receive with a counter offer to the buyer. They may want more information about the job, request the job be performed on a different date or they may want more money. </p>
    <p>It&#8217;s up to the buyer to accept the service pro&#8217;s new terms. A conditional acceptance does not keep the order from being routed to other providers, so it&#8217;s possible other providers may accept the work exactly as requested by the buyer.</p>
  </div>
  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="How do I get paid?" id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p>Service buyers pre-fund their ServiceLive Wallets when they post their service orders. Payment will be deposited to your ServiceLive account once the order is completed to the buyer&#8217;s satisfaction. The provider firm can withdraw ServiceLive funds via an online ACH request located in the ServiceLive Wallet.</p>
  </div>
  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="Why am I assessed a 10% service fee?" id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p>The 10% service fee is assigned to compensate for ServiceLive&#8217;s investment in the technology and marketing which includes credit card payment transaction costs. Our goal is to make ServiceLive the most robust tool for buyers and providers to connect with each other.</p>
    <p>Unlike other sites, providers are not charged any other fees for registering or for service orders. Providers should consider the value of these benefits as they accept work through ServiceLive.</p>
  </div>
  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="Who are the buyers?" id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p>Buyers are often homeowners or contractors looking for help from sub-contractors. Currently, most service orders are completed by commercial buyers for large corporations, which could include big-box retailers who have service obligations to fulfill on a national level. </p>
    <p>All buyers have pre-funded their accounts and scheduled their services so you know they are serious about having work completed and committed to paying you for a job well done.</p>
  </div>
  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="What happens if I can&#8217;t complete a service order to no fault of my own?" id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p>If you accept a service order that is then canceled by the buyer, the buyer will be assessed a $25 fee, which will be paid to the provider. If you arrive at the service location and cannot complete the service order through no fault of your own, the buyer will be assessed a $49 travel fee, which will be paid to the provider. </p>
  </div>
  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="What is a Select Provider Network(SPN)?" id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p> A Select Provider Network, commonly referred to as SPN, is a group of uniquely qualified Service Providers based on the criteria of the buyer. Each enterprise buyer will be able to create their own SPN that will be committed delivering Best-in-Class customer satisfaction to their customers.  Joining an SPN allows Service Providers more exclusive opportunities to receive service orders by specific buyers which could mean greater revenue potential. </p>

 <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="What should I do to minimize the possibility of a dispute?" id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p>At the start of every project there are guidelines one should follow to help avoid unexpected issues that may result in disputes between the buyer and service provider.</p>
    <ul class="vertBulleted">
    <li>When communicating with others, be precise in terms of what you require, what you will provide and what you expect of the other party.  Avoid making assumptions or providing vague details.</li>
    <ul class="vertBulleted">
    <li>Buyers should post service orders with clear scopes of work, well-defined deliverables that are time bound, and specify payment terms.</li>
    <li>Providers should only accept a service order with clear scopes of work that completely specify the key deliverable(s), timeframe for completing the work and payment terms.  Ask all clarifying questions up front, document any ambiguous items and validate all assumptions.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Keep the communication lines open throughout the project.  Always provide constructive feedback as the goal is to institute a positive change.  Explain precisely what needs to be changed and a timeline for correcting any problems.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" title="How are disputes handled?" id="" class="faqPane" open="false">
    <p>ServiceLive offers a number of communications tools you can use to resolve disputes if they arise.  Upon request of both parties, ServiceLive may provide voluntary, limited Dispute Resolution Assistance to work with buyers and providers to help them resolve their disputes; provided that final payment for services has not been issued.  In such instances where a buyer and service Provider are unable to mutually agree upon an equitable resolution, ServiceLive will forward the dispute to the Dispute Resolution Committee, which will review the case and offer a non-binding recommendation. In keeping with the spirit of the marketplace, we recommend the committee recommendation be accepted by all parties.</p>
